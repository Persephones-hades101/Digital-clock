## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

Digital clock

till now i have make main.java which is what will run the application
it call an instance of mywindow class which will show the time(digitally)
it also has a set alarm button that opens a new class setAlarmFrame where in you can set the alarm
although it doesnt play the alarm as algorithm is wrong. which will be corrected.
none of the setting in the use case diagram is added yet but a very basic structure is already given.
