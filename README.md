# Digital-clock

Digital clock

till now i have make main.java which is what will run the application
it call an instance of mywindow class which will show the time(digitally)
it also has a set alarm button that opens a new class setAlarmFrame where in you can set the alarm
although it doesnt play the alarm as algorithm is wrong. which will be corrected.
none of the setting in the use case diagram is added yet but a very basic structure is already given.
